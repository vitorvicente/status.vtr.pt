# status.vtr.pt

This website serves as a public status hub to report the current condition of my WebApps/Websites. It's one of the many pages I currently run under the vtr.pt domain, all of which are listed bellow.

As of now, this website is made up of a single HTML & CSS page using bootstrap, and was developed as a part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development.

### Running & Bug Finding
If you want to run the website to test for bugs or just mess around, all you have to do is download it and open the HTML files with your prefered browser.
